We all know that in our life there is a time where we have to go through hardships, not sure when will that time comes. Time is an entity which never stops and it's teaches us a lot's of things such as what is right, what is wrong, where to go, where not to go etc. etc.
This is the story of a boy who has faced a lot in his life. One thing was for sure that even the writer had to say.

> **Believe in the person who believes in you**

Apart from that we all know that one day or another we have to die. So sit tight, take a cup of your favorite energy booster (I prefer strong black coffee) and enjoy. Oh oh oh this is just a fantasy so can we keep it a promise?

Can you promise me pretty please ??🥹🥹🥹

## Chapter 1 - New beginning

![New Beginning](/images-story/new-beginning.png)

There was a town name [Willowmere](/page/Willowmere) where all the citizens lived happily. In this town everyone were helpful nature. We all like to live this type of town won't you agree.

Early morning where pleasant sound of bird singing and with positive energy everyone were greeting each other while going to work/doing work, somewhere in the town there was a family with the new born child name [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter). [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) was very cheerful and healthy, well as all we know that all the child's are happy. I love children's as they are cute and fluffy (so cute). As for [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) he was born in the middle class family in Jan 07, XX97, on his first birthday everyone was been happy as he was 1 year old. All the neighborhood gather around at [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) house to celebrate his first birthday, well this is the only day where you get gifts from your friends, family and neighbors.

As time passed on [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) grew up and was tine to go to school, well you all know that going to school on day one and completing school is a different story, we all know that on day 1 we cry a lot because our parents drops us at school like everyone does I bet you must also been cried a lot.

- **reader:** please don't make me blush
- **author:** well well someone face became red, even I cried a lot too, not even that I even....
- **reader:** ehm can we continue with our story or else he will hit you.

so as I was saying that its was time to for going school, it was hard for [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) going to school as he was always close to his parents, also it was hard for his parents to see their child getting separated for just few hours. Days went by [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) starting enjoying in the school as he made so many friends, after few months passed [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) started traveling in the school bus and he was comfortable with it. Day after day, month after month it was very pleasant for [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) to learn new things, after school he rushes to his mom and tell everything he learnt at school, not also that everyone in the home was excited to listen from him what he learned at the school. Some time passed he passed his nursery's and went to first standard with flying colors. You can say that [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) was an average student getting 70-80%. Now it was the real test for [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) as he passed nursery and moved on to first standard, the reason for saying this is that the hardship, ego, jealousy, truth etc. It was time for [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) to go-to new school and start learning about the real world. It was the first in the school enjoying the new environment, making new friends, trying to learn new things. There was a particular boy in the class sitting in the corner of the room silent, mysteries, sad and who know what's going on. No one was willing to look at him even you can say that no one was willing to go near him there were seats empty near him. There was really something about that boy in the corner who was just looking outside the window looking at the road.

- **reader:** hey, can we at least get that boys name
- **author:** well his name I DONT KNOW
- **reader:** come on what will be the fun if we don't know his name
- **author:** than what is the fun to listen to the story

So where were we at! Ooh ya got it we were taking about that boy in the conner of the class. [Ethan Carter](/page/Ethan-Carter) was curious about him, how can someone be so sad, depressed
