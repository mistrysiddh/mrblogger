# About Me 👋

Hey, I’m **Mr. Siddh Mistry** — welcome to my little corner of the internet!  

I’m someone who loves tinkering with tech, breaking things (and fixing them back again 😅), and sharing whatever I learn along the way. This blog is my open notebook where I document:  

- 🐧 Linux tips and tricks  
- 🖥️ Servers & self-hosting experiments  
- 🔐 Cybersecurity learnings  
- 🧩 Random projects with Raspberry Pi and other gadgets  

If I discover something cool, you’ll probably find it here. My hope is that these notes either help you out or spark an idea of your own 🚀  

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!
